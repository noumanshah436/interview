### **1. Backend Architecture and Design**
- **Understand scalability:** Be prepared to explain how you'd design systems to handle increasing load efficiently. Mention concepts like load balancing, database optimization, and horizontal/vertical scaling.
- **Microservices architecture:** Study its advantages, implementation strategies, and when it's appropriate to use.

---

### **2. Python Expertise**
- **Frameworks:** Review Django, Flask, and FastAPI. Understand their strengths, use cases, and performance considerations.
- **Best Practices:** Brush up on PEP-8, Pythonic coding, dependency injection, and error handling.

---

### **3. Vector Databases**
- Learn how vector databases like Pinecone, FAISS, and Weaviate work.
- **Use cases:** Understand similarity searches, embeddings, and integration with AI models.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Implement basic vector-based search queries.

---

### **4. Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Deployment and Fine-tuning:** Familiarize yourself with fine-tuning LLMs like GPT or BERT.
- **Applications:** Explore use cases such as chatbots, intelligent search engines, and summarization tools.
- **Frameworks:** Gain experience with Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI APIs.

---

### **5. API Development**
- **RESTful APIs:** Practice designing robust and secure APIs with clear endpoints, versioning, and error handling.
- **Third-party Integration:** Review integrating APIs like Slack, Google, or Microsoft.
- **GraphQL:** Be aware of its advantages and use cases compared to REST.

---

### **8. Coding Practices**
- Write clean, maintainable code with good documentation.
- Practice unit and integration testing using Pytest or Unittest.
- Review design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Repository.

---

### **9. Performance and Security**
- **Profiling and Optimization:** Use tools like `cProfile` and SQL query optimizers.
- **Security:** Study OWASP top 10, secure authentication, and authorization practices (e.g., OAuth2).

---

### **10. Communication and Problem-Solving**
- Be prepared to explain technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
- Demonstrate a structured problem-solving approach during coding or system design tasks.

---

### **Mock Interview**
- Simulate the interview environment with a friend or mentor, focusing on technical and behavioral questions.
