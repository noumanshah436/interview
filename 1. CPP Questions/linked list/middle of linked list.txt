/*How to Find Middle Element of a Linked List?
Method 1: Finding middle element of a linked in two traversal

i) Traverse a linked list and find the length of a linked list.
ii) Once we know the length of a linked list. We can traverse again upto length/2 and print the value of a node present at mid position.



Method 2: Find middle element in linked list in one pass using two pointers.

i) Use two pointer slow and fast. Initialized both the pointers to the head of a linked list.
ii) Move fast pointer by two step and slow pointer by one step in each iteration.
iii) When fast pointer reaches at the end of a linked list, The slow pointer points to the middle element of a linked list.

      //Middle of the Linked List LeetCode Solution


      public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        
        /*
           Declare two pointers and initialized with
           head.
        */
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
 
        //Move fast pointers by 2 step and slow by 1
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
 
 
         return slow;
      }
